1. DevOps Lifecycle for Business Agility
The DevOps lifecycle involves phases like Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, and Monitor. These phases work together to enable continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, resulting in faster time-to-market and greater business agility.

2. Define Scrum and Kanban Methodologies
Scrum: Scrum is an iterative framework for managing complex projects, where work is divided into Sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks, with regular ceremonies like Daily Standups and Sprint Retrospectives.
Product Backlog → Sprint Planning → Sprint (2-4 weeks) → Daily Scrum → Sprint Review → Sprint Retrospective → Increment

Kanban: Kanban is a visual workflow management method focused on continuous delivery, where tasks flow through stages like To Do, In Progress, and Done with work-in-progress limits.
To Do → In Progress (limit WIP) → Testing → Done



3. Differentiate Continuous Testing and Continuous Delivery
Continuous Testing involves automated tests at every stage of development to ensure code quality and reduce risks.
Continuous Delivery ensures that code is always in a release-ready state, allowing for quick and reliable deployments to production environments.

4. Draw the Delivery Pipeline
The typical DevOps pipeline includes stages such as Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor, automating the process from development to production, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
